# Personal Finance Analysis In BigQuery

> _"Data analysis is not just about presenting data, but to build a story and create a meaningful narrative from the raw data. At the end of the day, that's what analytics is all about - not about writing code, not about crunching numbers, not about memorizing formula syntax - it's about deriving meaning and context from the data and, more importantly, using it to make real change."_

## Problem Description

As one should, I have been keeping track of all my daily spending using Microsoft Excel. Using basic sorting/filtering in Excel I'm able to see a very high-level overview of my spending. In order to perform data analysis at a more deeper level, we will turn my static Excel data into Google BigQuery Table.




## Project Goals

Here are the questions I would like the PowerBI dashboards to answer:

- Find The unique Item.
- Duplicate checking.
- How many unique days money spent.
- Yearly cost by item.
- Show only the item with highest cost in each location.
- Monthly spending (in a given year).
- How much money spent per item category.
- List all expenses with comments.
- How much money spent per location.
- The number of purchases in various price ranges.
- Quarterly and weekly spending information.
- Various average costs (per week, month, day).
- Comparison of food costs to restaurant costs.
- Spending behavior when I'm sick.
- Comparison of weekday and weekend spending.
